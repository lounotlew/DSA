# WhataData - Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and Python
> Written by Lewis Kim

### Description

This repository contains various data structures and algorithms (e.g. linked lists, hashmaps, trees, Dijkstra's algorithm) implemented in both Python and Java, with potentially C++ to come. 

These DS&A are mainly for my practice/learning purposes, and may not necessarily be correct in its current state.
